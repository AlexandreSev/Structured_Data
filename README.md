## Presentation of unconstrained text recognition 

Text and letter recognition is a trending research topic. Applications of neural networks showed high accuracy. We develop a model for unconstrained recognition of words in natural images. It's an unconstrained recognition because there are no fixed lexicon and words have unknown length. 

To solve this unconstrained recognition problem we created a joint model thanks to a Conditional Random Field. This joint model is a combination of a character predictor model and a N-gram predictor model. Moreover we optimised this joint model by back-propagating the structured output loss. We observed better performances with the joint model than with the character sequence model alone.
